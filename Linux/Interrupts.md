Some commands run until the user quits them. 

# `Ctrl + C`

To send an interrupt to the program, telling it to quit, press `CTRL + C` in the terminal.
# `Ctrl + Z` 

The `Ctrl + Z` interrupt pauses the program's execution. To resume the task, type `fg`, for foreground. The `bg` moves the program to the background to continue running, which can be reopened with `fg`.
