Previously typed commands are stored in a unique history file for each terminal shell. In the BASH shell, the file is stored in the home folder named `.bash_history`

# Reading the History

The history file can be read like a text file or with the `history` command.

# Clearing the History

1. Delete the `.bash_history` file 
2. Clear history in memory: `history -c`
