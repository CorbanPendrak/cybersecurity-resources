The GUI is an abstraction of the terminal

## Prompt

The prompt can be customized and receives input

The prompt `corban@cyber:~$` shows that there is a user account "corban", the hostname is "cyber", and the current directory is the home folder ("~").

If the prompt is run as root, the "$" typically becomes "#", as in `corban@cyber:~#`

## Shell

The shell runs the programs. The most common is bash.

Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell, and the default path is /bin/bash
