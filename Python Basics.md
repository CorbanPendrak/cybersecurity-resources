These are some basics of the Python Language

# Print

Print using the simple `print` command:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

# Comments

Comments add notes to the source file that are ignored by the compiler. 

Comments should be used as a task list, notes for code, and disabling code.
## Single-line Comments

```python
# Print message
print("Look Comments!")
print("Comments are not read.") # Print info
```

## Multi-line Comments

```python
"""
This is a long comment.
It takes several lines,
but it explains the code well.
"""
print("Multi-line Comments are useful.")
```
