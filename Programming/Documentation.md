# Effective Searching

Searching online for information is the most common way to research and find examples.

Searching is not a weakness, but is searching effectively is a skill.

# Official Documentation

The official documentation with full details can be more helpful than examples.

The documentation for programming languages can be found online, or the language itself might help, like Python's `help()`.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are very feature rich and can help with tooltips for documentation.
