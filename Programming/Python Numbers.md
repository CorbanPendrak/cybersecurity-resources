Numbers are useful for math, data, tracking, and more. 

# Operations

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Normal division
- `**`: Exponent
- `//`: Divide without remainder
- `%`: Division remainder

# Types
## Integers

Integers are whole numbers. Basic math operations work with them `+ - * /`. 

## Floats

Floats are numbers with decimal places. The result of an operation with a float is a float, even if the float is a whole number: `4.6 + 2.4 = 7.0`

Floating point math is used by computer languages for floats and is efficient, but results can change slightly: `0.2 + 0.1 = 0.30000000000000004`.

Numbers can be rounded with `round(number, decimal_places)`: `round(42.31456, 2) -> 42.31`.
