Paradigms are the larger way to structure and organize code, especially for complex programs.

# Procedural Programming

This paradigm breaks down tasks into steps and separates the logic and data.

This is good for simple programs that runs through once.

# Object-oriented Programming

This paradigm focuses on collecting code and data into objects to use repetitively

An object can be for an article containing the title, date, and content attributes, along with methods like move shelf.

This tends to be more abstract with reusable programs for large and complex tasks.
