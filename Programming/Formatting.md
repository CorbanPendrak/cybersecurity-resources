Programming languages have varying syntax requirements, but generally allow for many styles, like tabs vs spaces. Using a style guide helps create consistency and is based on the language. IDEs can help by autoformatting code.

>You read code more than you write it.

# Style Guide Specifics

Some of the conventions listed in style guides are
- Number of characters for indentation
- Max characters on line
- Use of whitespace in expressions
- When to use comment types
- Variable name and format usage
- Use of trailing commas

Regardless of the style, consistency is most important.

# Code Habits

- Everything is commented
- Comments outweigh code extremely
- Long names
- Long parameter lists
- Duplicated code
- Inconsistent naming
- Very long files
## Too much nesting

Code really shouldn't go beyond 2-3 levels deep, otherwise it becomes difficult to read and reason.

## Ambiguous Variables

Variables should be readable and understandable, describing their content.

## Complex Functions

The longer a function is, the less readable and maintainable, and should be divided into smaller components.
