# Language Level

## Low-level

Low-level languages leave most of the processor details to the programmer. These programs can be more efficient, but harder to control. Examples include [[C MOC|C/C++]].
## High-level

High-level languages handles most of the processor details automatically. These programs are slightly less efficient, but safer. Examples include [[Python MOC|Python]] and [[JavaScript]].
