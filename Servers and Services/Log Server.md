Log servers store log events for a variety of levels and applications on systems across the network. These servers can identify the extent of attacks and secure logs. 

# Security vs Privacy

More monitoring can lead to better attacker prevention, but is hindered by legal and ethical constraints. 

# Tips

Here are a few tips for implementing a log server.

- Don't log everything! Building up is better than cutting down on data
- Implement security compliance
- Log effectively and securely
- Consider important security events, like authorization failure
- Challenge retention strategy
- Run a test
- Consider encryption
