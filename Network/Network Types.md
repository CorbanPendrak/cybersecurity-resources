The internet is a Wide Area Network (WAN), while smaller networks are Local Area Networks (LAN).
# Topologies

## Star

This is the most common, especially for home networks, as each computer connects to a central point. Easy to maintain separation but reliant on a single switch.

## Bus

All computers are connected to the same cable. Not as common because only one computer can communicate at a time.
