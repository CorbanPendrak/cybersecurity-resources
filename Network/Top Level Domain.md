# Authoritative Name Servers

The authoritative name server is the final [[Domain Name System|DNS]] server mapping the domain name directly to the IP address.

Reverse lookups convert the IP address to a domain name. in the format `1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa` for `192.168.0.1` for the domain.

A name server can store IP addresses for future requests for a short time to improve requests.
