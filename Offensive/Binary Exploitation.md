Binary exploits attack the compiled software.

# Buffer Overflows

A buffer overflow occurs when the user input overflows the memory reserved for the input by the program and can overwrite adjacent memory addresses. For numbers, this can include signed bits and floating point numbers.

# Searching for Exploits

A responsible disclosure informs the company that a security researcher found the bug. However, if the timeframe for updating is not reasonable or someone else discovers the exploit, it can be released. These releases can be found and applied by anyone.
