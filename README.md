Welcome to my repository for cybersecurity resources and notes.

This is mainly an informational repository of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files which I edit in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

The collection is currently hosted via [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) at [corbanpendrak.github.io/cybersecurity-resources/](https://corbanpendrak.github.io/cybersecurity-resources/).
