JavaScript is a programming language which runs inside a browser, unlike [[PHP]], but is visible from the website inside the [[HTML]].

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is the site's title tag.</title>
    <script>
      alert("Hello, World!");
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text...</p>
    <p>The second paragraph goes here.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
