PHP is a server-side programming language which can generate [[HTML]] to send. Unlike [[JavaScript]], PHP is run on the web server.

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is the site's title page.</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text...</p>
    <p>The second paragraph goes here.</p>
    <p>The result of 2 + 2 is <?php echo(2 + 2); ?></p>
  </body>
</html>
```
