- Why learn about [[OSI Model#TCP IP Model]] packets?
	- Signature-based protection
		- Fails against new attacks
	- Important for network conversations
	- To become and expert traffic analyst
- What are [[Packets]]?
	- Move information across networks
	- Produced by TCP/IP [[OSI Model#TCP IP Model]]
	- All communication activity across network.
	- Packet captures contain entire history of network
- Alerts
	- Who is attacking?
	- Who is the target?
	- Software tool or manual?
	- Responses from the target?
	- Assessment of attack
		- Harmless
		- Investigate
		- Emergency
		- Depends on uniqueness of attack
- VXLAN
	- Virtual Extensible Local Area Network
	- Commonly supported by cloud providers
	- Mirror cloud VLAN traffic
- TCP/IP
	- [[OSI Model]] is model for theory, [[OSI Model#TCP IP Model]] for application
	- Network Access layer
		- Ethernet
	- Internet layer
		- [[IP addresses]]
	- Transport layer
		- [[TCP Protocol]]/[[UDP Protocol]]
	- Application
		- [[HTTP Protocol]]
